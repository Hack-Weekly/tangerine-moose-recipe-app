    servings: "1 Servings",
    instructions:
      "Here's another, similar, recipe that's a bit more elaborate. Made it once and it was quite good. I usually make the other as it's more simple. The Nasi Kuning is more of a side dish while this makes a pretty satisfying meal. Heat the oil in a 1 1/2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat until hot. Add the rice and stir until it begins to brown, now add the cloves, cinnamon, turmeric and pepper; stir for a minute or so. Pour in the broth, add the salam or bay leaf and cumin. Bring to a rapid boil then cover and reduce the heat to a very low simmer. Simmer for about 40 minutes. Stir in the chicken and raisins; cover again and let sit, off the stove, for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with egg and tomato slices and the Onion Flakes. This is the basic Recipe. For variety try a teaspoon of ground chili instead of the black pepper. Other meats could be substituted for the chicken. Indonesian Crisp Beef is quite good with this, using it as a garnish instead of mixing in with the rice. Try anything you like, but don't put anything in to cook along with the rice, it might upset the liquid ratio and spoil things. The rice should come out with the grains separate and no stickiness.",

Stick a in few potatoes, a few sticks of cinnamon, a few black cardamoms, and many cloves of garlic, and some curry leaves. On top pour in saffron dissolved in skim milk. Add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup water. Secure and seal the lid (i seal by sticking dough right around the lid). bake in oven at medium (350 or so) for about an hour (just when you are ready to eat take it out). Its great and FF!! (i like to bake it enough to get some burnt rice at the bottom of the pan. you may want to spray the pan lightly with PAM to make it easier to get the burnt rice out)",
